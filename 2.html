        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for descri
            bing the presentation of a document written in a markup 
            language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, Mat
            hML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the 
            World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content
            , including 
            layout, colors, and fonts.[3] 
            This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flex
            ibility and control in the specification of 
            presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share for
            matting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css 
            file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural con
            tent; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the 
            page load speed between the pages that share the file and its forma
            tting.</p>
